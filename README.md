# 3_Project_Boost
Chapter 3 of 'Complete C# Unity Developer 3D' Course

A simple rocket thruster game made using Unity 3D.

Use the SPACE bar to thrust and A/D to rotate.

Contains a number of level challenges including moving blocks, dark level with torch, closing gaps.

Learned the basics of the Unity 3D platform, lighting, sine wave movement, level loading, and custom particle effects.

What I would change:

- Addition of menu and pause screens
- Power ups/decreasing fuel limit
- New level themes
